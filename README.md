# gottafixit
Proofread the web for fun and glory.

This repository contains code for the gottafixit server, Google Chrome extension, and the beginnings of a Firefox extension which hasn't been written yet.

To start the server, simply install meteor from http://meteor.com and run "meteor" from the gfi_serv directory.

The Chrome extension is also available in the chrome web store.
